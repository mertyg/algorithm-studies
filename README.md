# algorithm-studies

My own work on algorithms and their implementations.

CodingInterviewChX.py - These files contain my own implementations for solutions of problems in Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Edition by Gayle Laakmann McDowell. 
X: chapter number. I will update these files as I move forward in the book.

Other files contain different implementations and ideas from several books and practicing media, such as leetcode or hackerrank.

basic_algorithms.py - This file contains some of the general purpose algorithms, including arithmetic and sorting operations.

divide_and_conquer.py - This file contains some of the general divide and conquer algorithms.
